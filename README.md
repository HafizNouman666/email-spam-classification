# Email Spam Classifier with Streamlit Frontend

## Overview

This project is an implementation of an email spam classifier with a user-friendly frontend built using Streamlit. The classifier is trained on a dataset of labeled emails, distinguishing between spam and non-spam (ham) emails. Users can interact with the classifier through a simple and intuitive web interface provided by Streamlit.

## Features

- **Email Spam Classification**: The core functionality of the project is the ability to classify emails as spam or ham.
- **Streamlit Frontend**: The project utilizes Streamlit to create a frontend interface for users to interact with the classifier.
- **Input Email Text**: Users can input email text into the interface, and the classifier will predict whether it's spam or ham.
- **Display Prediction Results**: The interface displays the prediction results to the user, indicating whether the input email is classified as spam or ham.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn (for the classifier)
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
